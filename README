ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
given 1 argument the program creates directory with the name "Welcome", in This directory it crates
another directory named "To", and inside this directory it creates a file in write-only mode, named
"OS2021". Inside the file the program writes "<user name>\nIf you haven't read the course
guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n1". After that the program deletes the file and the two
directories. If a wrong number of arguments are given the program prints
"Error. The program should receive a single argument. Exiting.\n" and after that ": Success\n".
